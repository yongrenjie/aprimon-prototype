aprimon should be listed one per line. The standard format is <BALL> <SPECIES>,
e.g.

    Beast Togepi
    Dream Togepi

Capitalisation as well as punctuation is ignored, but the parser is sensitive
to typos in names so please ensure that everything is spelt correctly.

It does try to remove things such as non-alphabetical characters where
possible. It also removes strings such as 'HA' or 'Ball', or anything in
parentheses. So, the following (or various combinations thereof) will all work:

    1. Fast Togepi
    Friend Togepi (x9)
    Heavy Ball Togepi
    Level HA Togepi

or combinations thereof (hopefully less obnoxious than this example):

    13. Love Ball HA Togepi (x10000)

Regional forms can be entered in several different ways. All of the following
should work (plus any form of punctuation or none):

    Beast Diglett (Alola)
    Dream Ball Alolan Diglett
    Fast Diglett-A (2x)

Note, however, that the website doesn't treat regional forms any differently
from the standard forms, because these can all be crossbred. So, if you enter
'Lure Diglett-Alola', it will still display as 'Lure Diglett'.
